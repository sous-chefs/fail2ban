# fail2ban Cookbook CHANGELOG

This file is used to list changes made in each version of the fail2ban cookbook.

## 5.0.1 (2018-02-15)

- Update the minimum supported Chef release to 12.9 since we're using the Ohai package plugin now. We highly recommend you run at least the very latest Chef 12 reelase which includes additional packabe plugin fixes.

## 5.0.0 (2018-02-14)

- Add new logic to detect the fail2ban version and apply appropriate config for 0.8 vs > 0.8. This makes sure we're using the current on newer systems while still supporting Ubuntu 14.04
- Remove defunct syslog config statements from very old fail2ban releases

## 4.0.1 (2017-04-26)

- Update apache2 license string

## 4.0.0 (2017-03-14)

**NOTE** The next version of this cookbook will be a rewrite to use custom resources and eliminate attributes. This should be backwards compatible to previous versions of the cookbook, but there are some changes that might break current assumptions so doing a major bump.

- [#33] Fix ubuntu platforms
- Add ubuntu platform guards to default recipe
- Update README to be more clear with regards to rsyslog
- Remove defaults-debian.conf on ubuntu platforms, that assumes ssh enabled on nodes.
